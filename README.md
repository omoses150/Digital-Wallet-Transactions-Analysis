### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze how the digital wallets influence consumer purchasing decisions, identify patterns and trends. The goal is to understand the effect of different digital wallets in making payments for various product categories across different merchants.

### Objectives

1. To understand the spending patterns across different product categories. 
2. To measure transaction volumes across different locations.
3. To understand market share for each merchant in terms of product distribution.
4. To calculate transaction fee generated by each payment method.
5. To calculate total cashback by product category.
6. To determine total loyalty points per each merchant.
7. To measure transaction volumes done on each device type.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 'digital_wallet_transactions.csv', a file containing detailed information about 5000 synthetic records of various financial transactions across multiple categories, providing a rich source for analysis of digital payment behaviors and trends.

#### Data Description

The dataset includes the following features;
- idx: Unique index for each record
- transaction_id:Unique identifier for each transaction (UUID)
- user_id: Unique identifier for each user
- transaction_date: Date and time of the transaction
- product_category: Category of the product or service
- product_name: Specific product or service name
- merchant_name: Name of the merchant or service provider
- product_amount: Transaction amount in local currency
- transaction_fee: Fee charged for the transaction
- cashback: Cashback amount received for the transaction
- loyalty_points: Loyalty points earned from the transaction
- payment_method: Method used for payment
- transaction_status: Status of the transaction (Successful, Failed, Pending)
- merchant_id: Unique identifier for each merchant
- device_type: Type of device used for the transaction
- location: Broad location category of the transaction

### Tools Used

- Python - Used for data preprocessing and analysis.
- SQL Server   - For data analysis and establishing a connection with Power BI.
- Power BI     - Used for visualization.

### Data Preprocessing

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks;
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Checking for and handling missing values incase of any.
3. Checking for and handling duplicates incase of any.
4. Address any inconsistencies in data entries, such as incorrect formats in "Date"

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the digital wallet transactions data to answer key questions that form our objectives.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the digital wallet transactions data to answer key questions that form our objectives.

#### Multivariate Analysis

Studying the relationships between various numerical columns: 'product_amount', 'transaction_fee', 'cashback', 'loyalty_points'.

Building a heatmap to show correlation- Whether there is a stong relationship amongst various numerical measures.

#### Hypothesis Testing

I conducted this test to determine if there is enough evidence to conclude a significant difference in average transaction amounts between Android and iOS devices.

#### Analysis Outcome

- There is not enough evidence to conclude a significant difference in average transaction amounts between Android and iOS devices.
- There is no strong relationship among the numerical parameters in the dataset which include loyalty_points,cashback, transaction_fee and product amount. This is because the values in the correlation heatmap are near zero.

### Conclusion/ Findings

1. Most of the transactions were done in urban centres and through Android.
2. Streaming services, Water bill, Gas bill, Education fee and Movie ticket form the top five product categories in terms of the amount spent.
3. Airbnb, FlipKart and MakeMyTrip are the top three popular merchants in terms of the product categories bought.
4. There is no much difference in terms of the transaction fee generated through different payment methods.
5. Much cashback was obtained from streaming service and Education fee.
6. Customers generated a lot of loyalty points when they made payments for Airbnb.
7. Most transactions were done through Bank transfer.

### Recommendation

1. Much digital wallet transactions awareness/campaigns need to be done in Suburban and Rural areas to inrease the transaction volumes.
2. Any merchant planning to integrate their payment system with digital wallets need to consider investing in customer loyalty points as this, in my view, is what has made Airbnb the top merchant.
3. There is need to collect the data further for at least three more years to analyze the spending behavious over time. This will help in predicting the future trends for digital wallet transactions.

###   Limitation

I dropped some columns during analysis, 'idx', 'transaction_id', 'merchant_id' and 'user_id', because in my view they had no significant role or could have otherwise affected the quality of my analysis.
